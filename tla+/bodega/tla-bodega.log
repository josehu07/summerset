Progress(30) at 2025-06-06 21:36:23: 43,135,167 states generated (15,063,630 s/min), 16,817,684 distinct states found (6,496,872 ds/min), 1,837,258 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.5E-5
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.3E-5
51743493 states generated, 20431063 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 37.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 16 and the 95th percentile is 3).
